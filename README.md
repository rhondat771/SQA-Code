# SQA-Code
This repository will contain code demonstrating end to end, full stack tests. The code is regularly used across industries on webapps that use similar tech stacks. Common tech stack includes: Html, Js, Rest API, Selenium WebDriver, PostMan, SQL/ Management tools: Git, Jira, Jenkins, Visual Studio, Azure, AWS.  The code is applicable across industries because webapps use common page objects and are not industry specific. The primary differences determined by industry is application workflow, type of data required for the page objects, API functions or microservices, standards or regulations that dictate app layout. Again, all of these differences are manageable by the tech stack and management tools above.
